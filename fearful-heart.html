    <h1>Fearful Heart's Enemy</h1>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>Time won’t stop to watch you doubt,
      It walks away while you figure things out.
      You stall, you hope, you think it through
      But time moves on without a cue.</p>

      <p>You keep your words, afraid to fall,
      In fear they won’t mean much at all.
      So close your lips, miss your chance
      While love walks by without a glance.</p>

      <p>You tell yourself, maybe next day,
      But somehow, that gets swept away.
      And what you feel just fades to ache
      A silent heart, a slow heartbreak.</p>

      <p>They laugh, they leave, they never knew
      The things you never said were true.
      Not lost in war, or some great fight
      Just gone because you froze that night.</p>

      <p>The ones who love, they speak, they try.
      They risk the no, they brave goodbye.
      But those who wait for perfect signs
      Are left behind by steady time.</p>

      <p>So say it now. Don’t waste the fire.
      The heart grows cold with each desire
      That’s kept too long, or tucked away
      And never lives to see the day.</p>
