        <p>Time won’t stop to watch you doubt,<br>
        It walks away while you figure things out.<br>
        You stall, you hope, you think it through<br>
        But time moves on without a cue.</p>

      <div class="poem">
        <p>You keep your words, afraid to fall,<br>
        In fear they won’t mean much at all.<br>
        So close your lips, miss your chance<br>
        While love walks by without a glance.</p>

      <div class="poem">
        <p>You tell yourself, maybe next day,<br>
        But somehow, that gets swept away.<br>
        And what you feel just fades to ache<br>
        A silent heart, a slow heartbreak.</p>

    <div class="slide">
      <div class="poem">
        <p>They laugh, they leave, they never knew<br>
        The things you never said were true.<br>
        Not lost in war, or some great fight<br>
        Just gone because you froze that night.</p>

    <div class="slide">
      <div class="poem">
        <p>The ones who love, they speak, they try.<br>
        They risk the no, they brave goodbye.<br>
        But those who wait for perfect signs<br>
        Are left behind by steady time.</p>

    <div class="slide">
      <div class="poem">
        <p>So say it now. Don’t waste the fire.<br>
        The heart grows cold with each desire<br>
        That’s kept too long, or tucked away<br>
        And never lives to see the day.</p>
