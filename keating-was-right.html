        <h1>Keating Was Right</h1>
        <div class="poem">
            <p>Some mornings, I oversleep.<br>The alarm screams, I hit snooze,<br>and before I know it, an hour’s gone.<br>My coffee’s cold before I take a sip,<br>and the day already feels like it’s slipping away.</p>

            <p>But I get up anyway, because what else is there to do?<br>Life doesn’t wait until I feel ready.<br>It never has.</p>

            <p>Keating said, “Seize the day.”<br>But no one ever tells you that seizing the day<br>doesn’t always mean doing something big.</p>

            <p>It’s not just about standing on desks<br>or shouting poetry into the wind.<br>Most of the time, it’s smaller than that.</p>

            <p>It’s getting out of bed<br>when you’d rather stay buried under the covers.<br>It’s speaking up when your voice wavers.<br>It’s making a choice—even a tiny one—<br>when doubt tells you to stand still.</p>

            <p>No one has it all figured out.<br>We try, we fail, we start over.<br>And maybe that’s the whole point.<br>Maybe life isn’t about getting it perfect,<br>but about showing up, however messy or uncertain it feels.</p>

            <p>So, I’ll keep going.<br>I’ll stumble, I’ll second-guess,<br>I’ll laugh at my own mistakes.<br>But I won’t wait for the perfect moment,<br>because that moment doesn’t exist.</p>

            <p>I’ll take what I have—right here, right now—<br>and I’ll do something with it.</p>

            <p>Keating was right.<br>Seize the day, come what may.</p>
