        With the passage of time, a fresh view has gradually come into perspective, unveiling something that I once passed by without even looking back. Something that was at the fringes of my mind is now at the center of my focus. Where previously I may have dismissed the little things that make you who you are, now they stand out to me in ways I never thought possible. Something within me has changed, and the way I perceive you has entirely shifted, though I'm not sure how to put it into words.

        It's as though my heart and mind have begun to identify a beauty and complexity I was previously unaware of. It's not merely an intellectual interest, but a soulful attraction that compels me to know more, to explore beyond the surface. I find myself wanting to understand more of the real you—the parts that aren't immediately obvious, the things beneath the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't just want to see the outline of your life anymore; I want to understand the heart of it—the quiet details that shape your world. It is not a craving stimulated by mere interest, but by deeper attraction, a feeling that you are more than I ever dreamed. And with that discovery, I can barely wait to embark on a journey of discovery, to behold the true, unspoken beauty of all that you truly are.
