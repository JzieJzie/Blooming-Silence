        <h1>Beloved Stranger</h1>
        <div class="poem">
            <p>Traces of her presence still remain,<br>a fleeting look that set my heart aflame.<br>Our paths entwined by fate's own hand,<br>my soul knew hers, a love unplanned.</p>

            <p>Time stood still as young hearts raced,<br>in quiet moments, love was traced.<br>Desire swelled, a silent plea—<br>a love unspoken, lost to me.</p>

            <p>Now adrift in memories past,<br>he lets go of love held fast.<br>A near romance slipped through space and time,<br>leaving only echoes left behind.</p>

            <p>Laughter lingers, whispers stay,<br>haunting nights in a wistful way.<br>Her smile—a specter I adore,<br>etched in a love left unexplored.</p>

            <p>In dreams, our hearts still beat as one,<br>but dawn reveals what's come undone.<br>A longing etched in silent pain,<br>a love that bloomed yet died in vain.</p>

            <p>Summer winds still breathe her name,<br>my heart beats fast, yet stays the same.<br>Endless questions fill my mind,<br>of love that fate kept misaligned.</p>

            <p>Through crowded streets, I seek her face,<br>a fleeting hope, a touch of grace.<br>But she's not there—it's just a trick,<br>a love that vanished far too quick.</p>

            <p>In quiet hours, I retrace,<br>the moments lost, the things misplaced.<br>A glance, a touch, a whispered word,<br>a bittersweet song left unheard.</p>

            <p>Does she wonder? Did she know?<br>Was I just a flame's brief glow?<br>The doubt remains, it lingers still,<br>a haunting song against my will.</p>

            <p>In midnight's hush, I hear her voice,<br>a fragile dream, a fleeting choice.<br>But morning comes to break the spell,<br>leaving echoes where love once dwelled.</p>

            <p>The emptiness still calls her name,<br>a hollow ache, a ghostly frame.<br>Each step I take feels worlds apart,<br>from love once held within my heart.</p>

            <p>What-ifs linger, whisper low,<br>of love undone, yet still aglow.<br>My soul still longs for what it knew,<br>a love too much, a loss too true.</p>

            <p>Among the crowds, in strangers' smiles,<br>I chase her ghost through empty miles.<br>Hope ignites, then fades to night,<br>a dream dissolving into twilight.</p>

            <p>Perhaps in time, in fate's embrace,<br>we'll find each other, not misplace.<br>But in this life, love stays confined—<br>a melody lost, a heart resigned.</p>

            <p>Beneath the stars, I search again,<br>for reasons why, for whispered when.<br>But silence answers, distant, cold,<br>and love's untold story stays untold.</p>
